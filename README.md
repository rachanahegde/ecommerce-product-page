# E-commerce Product Page

This e-commerce product page was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. The page features a lightbox product gallery and cart functionality. Users are able to add and remove items to/from cart and view cart. Furthermore, there is a side navigation menu for mobile view. The design for this website was provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).

## Overview

### Key Functionality

For this Frontend Mentor challenge, the goal was to implement the following functionality:

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
